TIMESTAMP
    Number of nanoseconds since epoch
    64-bits (unsigned long long int)
NUM GAMES
    32-bit integer (uint32_t)
    Number of games in the database
    Write 0 at first; go back and update after data is written
TAG ENUM SIZE
    32-bit integer (uint32_t)
    Number of strings in tag enum
    Write 0 at first; go back and update after data is written
PGN TAGS
    32-bit integer (uint32_t)
    Value refers to index of HEADER list
    16 tags per game x 4 bytes per tag = 64 bytes per game
NUM PLIES
    16-bit integer (uint16_t)
    Indicates total number of plies for current game
MOVETEXT
    Sequence of plies
    Each ply is 2 bytes (uint16_t aka eply)
TAG ENUM
    Newline delmited strings
    First entry is empty string
    Order of strings defines their enumeration
    ie. first string has enum value 0, followed by 1, etc.
